# iOSRingingRoom
A native iOS client for [Ringing Room](https://github.com/lelandpaul/virtual-ringing-room)

It will be available soon on the App Store.

## About The Project

It is built 100% using SwiftUI.

This is my first real-life coding project, let alone my first SwiftUI one, so the code is definately sub-optimal. If you can improve it in anyway, please do. Any contributions are greatly appreciated. To contribute:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b my-new-branch`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Describe what you've changed'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin my-new-branch`)
5. Open a Pull Request

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Comments coming soon!
