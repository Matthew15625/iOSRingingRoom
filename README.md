# iOSRingingRoom
A native iOS client for [Ringing Room](https://github.com/lelandpaul/virtual-ringing-room)

It will be available soon on the App Store.

## About
I had 2 clear goals in mind when I started this project: to make it easier for people to use Ringing Room on their iOS devices, and to learn more about Swift and SwiftUI. I am pleased to say that I achieved both of these. I managed to make the project using 100% SwiftUI, while making (what I think at least is) a great UX.

## Contributing

As this is my first Swift/SwiftUI project, there are undoubtedly many ways to improve it. If you can in any way, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.

Comments coming soon!
